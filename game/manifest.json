	"description": "2048 is a popular sliding puzzle game in which the player combines numbered tiles on a grid to create a tile with the number 2048. The game is won when the player creates the 2048 tile, but play can continue for a higher score. Players move tiles by swiping them in four directions, and two tiles of the same number will merge into a single tile with their combined value when they collide. The game is simple to learn but difficult to master, with endless possibilities for strategic play.",
